**Task 1: Economic Dashboard Creation**
**Scenario:**
You are a Data Analyst tasked with creating an interactive dashboard to showcase global economic indicators from the IMFâ€™s Global Economic Outlook. The objective is to help policymakers and the public understand economic performance trends over time or provide an annual snapshot of key economic indicators.

**Dataset Used:**
Global Economic Outlook dataset from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
The dataset includes indicators from 2001 to 2020 for multiple countries.
44 economic indicators were analyzed, and a subset was selected for visualization in the dashboard.
**Key Insights:**
The dashboard allows users to explore economic trends and select specific years for performance snapshots.
Visualizations such as trend graphs, bar charts, and key performance indicators (KPIs) were created to present economic data effectively.


**Task 2: Statistical Analysis of Concrete Compressive Strength**
**Scenario:**
As a consultant, you are tasked with conducting a statistical analysis for a construction company testing different concrete mixes. The goal is to explore how the composition of concrete affects its compressive strength.

**Dataset Used:**
**Concrete Compressive Strength dataset**
This dataset includes variables such as cement, water, and aggregates, and their relationship to the compressive strength of concrete.
Key Insights:
Correlation analysis reveals that Cement and Age have strong relationships with compressive strength.
Regression modeling identifies significant factors affecting compressive strength.
Hypothesis tests are conducted to assess the impact of Cement and Fly Ash inclusion on concrete performance.
